Scenario: 
You are developing an employee management system for a company. Efficiently managing employee records is crucial.
Steps:
1.	Understand Array Representation:
1.a.	Explain how arrays are represented in memory and their advantages.
Ans: Array Representation in Memory and Advantages:
Contiguous Memory: Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations, allowing efficient direct access. The address of each element is calculated using a base address plus an offset, making element access very fast.
Indexing: Arrays use zero-based indexing for direct access to elements, enabling constant-time retrieval (O(1)).
Fixed Size: The size of an array is fixed upon creation, leading to efficient memory usage but lacking flexibility for dynamic resizing.

Advantages:
Fast Access: Direct access to elements using indices is very quick (O(1)).
Memory Efficiency: Minimal overhead due to contiguous memory allocation.
Performance: Benefits from cache locality, which can improve access speeds.
Simplicity: Easy to implement and use with built-in support in many programming languages.

4.	Analysis:
4.a.	Analyze the time complexity of each operation (add, search, traverse, delete).
Ans : Add:
Time Complexity: O(1) on average if there's space in the array. 
If the array is full and needs to be expanded, the complexity is O(n) due to copying elements to a new array.
Search:
Time Complexity: O(n) because each element might need to be checked sequentially in the worst case.
Traverse:
Time Complexity: O(n) as each element must be visited once.
Delete:
Time Complexity: O(n) because elements need to be shifted to fill the gap left by the removed item.

4.b.	Discuss the limitations of arrays and when to use them.
Ans : Limitations:
Fixed Size: Arrays have a fixed size which cannot be changed dynamically after creation.
Expensive Insertions and Deletions: Inserting or deleting elements requires shifting, which can be inefficient.
Memory Waste: If the array is over-allocated, there can be wasted memory.

When to Use Arrays:
Known Size: When the number of elements is known in advance and does not change frequently.
Fast Access Needed: When fast, constant-time access to elements is required.
Simple Use Cases: For simple scenarios where dynamic resizing is not necessary and overhead needs to be minimal.
