Scenario: 
You are developing a financial forecasting tool that predicts future values based on past data.
Steps:
1.	Understand Recursive Algorithms:
1.a. 	Explain the concept of recursion and how it can simplify certain problems.
Ans : Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It involves two main components: 
a base case to terminate the recursion and a recursive case where the function calls itself with modified arguments.

How It Simplifies Problems:
Problem Breakdown: Recursion divides a complex problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.
Simpler Code: It often leads to cleaner and more intuitive code, especially for problems with a natural recursive structure.
Reduced Complexity: It simplifies code by removing the need for complex loops and state management.


4.	Analysis:
4.a.	Discuss the time complexity of your recursive algorithm.
Ans : Time Complexity: For the recursive calculateFutureValue method, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of years. 
This is because the function makes a recursive call for each year, resulting in n recursive calls. Each call performs a constant amount of work (a multiplication and addition).

4.b.	Explain how to optimize the recursive solution to avoid excessive computation.
Ans : Memoization: Store the results of each recursive call in a cache or array. If the function is called with the same parameters again, return the cached result instead of recalculating. 
This reduces redundant calculations and speeds up the process.
Iterative Approach: Replace recursion with an iterative approach when possible. For instance, using a loop to calculate the future value instead of recursion can be more efficient and avoids issues with stack overflow for large n.
Tail Recursion Optimization: Some languages optimize tail-recursive functions to avoid increasing the call stack depth. Ensure that the recursion is tail-recursive if your language/compiler supports this optimization.
